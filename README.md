## About the Project
It is a JavaScript project that I created to practice the web development and the project is assign by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). It is a game that can be played in browser either against someone or computer or computer vs computer (LOL). Computer can be set to be easy or hard. In easy mode, computer will make a random move. In hard mode, computer will make a move that will win the game, believe me you can't win in the hard mode.

In the start page there is an input field for name of the player (if nothing entered it will fallback to default name i.e. `Player 1` and/or `Player 2`) and a checkbox, if the player is computer or not. If the player is computer, there will be a field for selecting difficulty. This process will repeat for other player after clicking the Save & Next button, then on clicking the Save & Play button game will start. I tried to make the game little bit nicer by using the some transition, I hope you would like it.
